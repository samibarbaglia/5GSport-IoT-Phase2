# üåê Metropolia x Nokia 5G Sport Project (Phase 2, IoT)

This project integrates a **Movesense device** and a **Bynav M10 module** with a **Raspberry Pi Pico WH**, forming an IoT system that collects movement and GNSS data and forwards it to an MQTT broker over Wi-Fi. 
Phase 2 added new GNSS functionality (DFRobot TEL0157 replaced by Bynav M10).

Code of Phase 2 is based on Phase 1 (https://github.com/hannahhoang2704/IoTSport-IceHockey-Tracker). 
The biggest changes to it were the deletion of GNSS_sensor.py + DFRobot_GNSS.py files and the addition of bynav_GNSS.py file.

## üì± movesense-device-app

Firmware application for the Movesense device.

### üîß Description

The application utilizes the GATT SensorData protocol to communicate with a client device (Raspberry Pi Pico WH). It includes a movement detection feature and implements power-saving behavior:

- If no movement is detected and BLE connection is lost for 60 seconds, the Movesense device enters PowerOff mode to conserve battery.
- The device automatically wakes from PowerOff when:
  - Movement is detected, or
  - A BLE connection is re-established.

## üß† picoW-app

Firmware application for the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.

### üîß Description

The Pico WH functions as both a microcontroller, an IoT gateway, and RTK bridge, performing the following tasks:

- Connects to the Movesense device using the GATT SensorData service to retrieve sensor data.
- Reads location data from a GNSS module (Bynav M10).
- Connects to caster to send location data to VRS + forwards RTK correction data from VRS back to Bynav.
- Forwards combined data to a pre-configured MQTT broker over Wi-Fi.

Tested on MicroPython firmware v1.22.

### üß† MicroPython firmware v1.22

üîó The BLE stack is re-configured with built firmware `micropython-v1.22-blestack.uf2`, allow the Pico WH to connect to up to 3 peripherals simultaneously with GATT protocol.

### üì¶ Required MicroPython Packages
